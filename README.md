This project is a simple calculator built in PHP using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. 
The application supports basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The MVC structure is implemented to separate business logic, presentation, and data handling, making the code more organized and maintainable.
